Amazmod – the missing link for Pace and Stratos.

Thought that your watch can't do more? Well, it sure can!
Amazmod is a completing application for the Amazfit Client, compatible with the Store/Mi store versions, based on server/client configuration for your Amazfit watches, and is capable of working in two configurations:

1.  No additional software on the watch – no installation is needed on your watch, just few specific settings changes in the Amazfit app.
2.  Service component running on the watch – no root required for additional functionality, a manual installation is required on the watch with the provided semi-automated user friendly installer.
